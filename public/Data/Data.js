    description: `Times have certainly changed this past year. While many people had already been looking for ways to work remotely, nobody expected to be thrown into working from home overnight. Suddenly an entire workforce had to figure out ways to make working from home more comfortable and efficient. When thinking about what to get that someone who has transitioned from the office to remote working, we decided to put together the best work from home gifts that have helped us create a better workspace over the past three years.
    

      Before settling down in 2018 we had been on the road for eight years.
