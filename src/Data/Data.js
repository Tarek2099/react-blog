    description: `Times have certainly changed this past year. While many people had already been looking for ways to work remotely, nobody expected to be thrown into working from home overnight. Suddenly an entire workforce had to figure out ways to make working from home more comfortable and efficient. When thinking about what to get that someone who has transitioned from the office to remote working, we decided to put together the best work from home gifts that have helped us create a better workspace over the past three years.
    

      Before settling down in 2018 we had been on the road for eight years. When we transitioned from working on the road to having a home office, we wanted to make sure we had the most inviting office space to inspire our best work. Through trial and error, we have found great office gadgets, gear, and decor to create the ultimate home office. If you know someone who works from home, these gift ideas should help you get creative when finding the perfect holiday gift. So let’s get shopping.
